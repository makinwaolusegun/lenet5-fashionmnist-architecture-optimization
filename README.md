# lenet5-fashionmnist-architecture-optimization
This project implements a LeNet-5 convolutional neural network trained on the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch.
Multiple experiments were conducted by varying convolution layers, pooling types, activation functions, and filter counts to optimize performance.
The best configuration achieved a validation accuracy of 90.37%.

ðŸ“Š Conclusion

Model 5, with 4 convolution layers, ReLU activation, average pooling, and [8, 18] filters, produced the highest validation accuracy (90.37%), outperforming other tested configurations.
