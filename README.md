# lenet5-fashionmnist-architecture-optimization
Implementation of a LeNet-5 CNN trained on the FashionMNIST dataset. Includes experiments with convolution layers, pooling types, activation functions, and filter counts to optimize performance, achieving validation accuracy above 80%.
LeNet-5 FashionMNIST Experiments
üìå Overview

This project implements a LeNet-5 convolutional neural network trained on the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch.
Multiple experiments were conducted by varying convolution layers, pooling types, activation functions, and filter counts to optimize performance.
The best configuration achieved a validation accuracy of 90.37%.
