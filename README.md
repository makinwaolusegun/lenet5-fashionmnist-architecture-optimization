# lenet5-fashionmnist-architecture-optimization
This project implements a LeNet-5 convolutional neural network trained on the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch.
To optimize performance, multiple experiments were conducted using varying convolution layers, pooling types, activation functions, and filter counts.
The best configuration achieved a validation accuracy of 90.37%.

ðŸ“Š Conclusion
Model 5, with 4 convolution layers, ReLU activation, average pooling, and [8, 18] filters, produced the highest validation accuracy (90.37%), outperforming other tested configurations.
